# Ruby on Rails Technical Interview Questions:


## Basic
#### 1. What is MVC?
MVC stands for **Model-View-Controller**. It is a design pattern used in Rails to separate concerns in an application:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database to retrieve and store information.
- **View**: The presentation layer that displays the data to the user. It is typically HTML or JSON for web apps.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It processes user input, calls the necessary model methods, and renders the appropriate view.

#### Example:
```
# Model
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
end

# Controller
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
end

# View (show.html.erb)
<h1><%= @post.title %></h1>
<p><%= @post.body %></p>

```
#### 2. What is ActiveRecord?
ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer in Rails that facilitates communication between the application and the database. It maps database tables to Ruby classes, allowing you to interact with the database using Ruby objects.

ActiveRecord automatically handles CRUD operations.
It allows you to query, insert, update, and delete database records without needing to write raw SQL.
Example:
```
# Finding a record
user = User.find(1)

# Creating a new record
user = User.create(name: "John", email: "john@example.com")

# Updating a record
user.update(name: "John Doe")

# Deleting a record
user.destroy
```
#### 3. What are callbacks in Rails?
Callbacks in Rails are methods that get called at certain points of an object's lifecycle. They allow you to hook into and modify the behavior of ActiveRecord objects before or after certain events, such as saving, updating, or destroying records.

Common Callbacks:
before_save, after_save
before_create, after_create
before_update, after_update
before_destroy, after_destroy
Example:
```

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :set_default_title

  private

  def set_default_title
    self.title = "Untitled" if title.blank?
  end
end
```
#### 4. What is mass assignment?
Mass assignment occurs when you assign values to multiple attributes of an object at once, typically using the update or create methods. This is a feature in Rails that lets you assign values to several attributes in a single step.

Mass assignment vulnerability occurs when an attacker can update attributes that they shouldn't be allowed to, such as sensitive fields.

Example of mass assignment:
```
# Allowed attributes: name, email
user = User.new(name: "John", email: "john@example.com", admin: true)  # admin should not be assignable!
Follow-up: How do you protect your app against it?
You can prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities by using strong parameters in Rails, which explicitly define which attributes are allowed to be mass-assigned.



class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)  # Only allow name and email
  end
end
```


#### 5. What is CSRF?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where a malicious website can send unauthorized requests to a web application where the user is already authenticated. It tricks the user into performing an unintended action.

Follow-up: How is it handled in Rails?
Rails protects against CSRF by using a CSRF token. This token is generated on each form and ensures that the request came from your site and not from an external source.

Rails includes the token in every form by default, and it’s checked on form submissions.

Example:
```
<%= form_with(url: posts_path, method: :post) do %>
  <%= text_field_tag :title %>
  <%= submit_tag "Create Post" %>
<% end %>
```
Rails automatically includes a hidden CSRF token in forms generated by form_with.

#### 6. How do you handle database migrations in Rails?
Database migrations in Rails are used to manage changes to the database schema over time. They allow you to version-control your database structure, making it easy to roll back or apply changes.

Migrations are stored in files in the db/migrate directory.
They can be run using rails db:migrate.
Example:
```
# Migration to add a title column to the posts table
class AddTitleToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :posts, :title, :string
  end
end
Run the migration:

rails db:migrate
```
#### 7. What is a scope?
A scope in Rails is a way to define commonly-used queries that can be reused throughout the application. It’s defined within the model and is typically used to simplify querying the database.

Example:
```
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
  scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc).limit(5) }
end

# Usage
Post.published.recent
```
#### 8. What is the difference between has_one and belongs_to?
has_one: This association indicates that one object can have one related object. It is typically used on the "one" side of a relationship.
belongs_to: This association indicates that an object belongs to another object. It is used on the "many" side of the relationship.
Example:
```
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile  # Author has one profile
end

class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author  # Profile belongs to an author
end

In this case, an Author has one Profile, and a Profile belongs to an Author.
```
#### 9. What is Rails Console, and how do you use it?
The Rails Console (rails console or rails c) is an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows developers to run Ruby and Rails commands inside an application’s environment.

Usage:

```
rails console  # Start console in default (development) mode
rails console --sandbox  # Run console with changes rolled back after exit
rails console production  # Start console in production environment
Example:

# Create a new user
user = User.create(name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com")

# Find a user
user = User.find_by(email: "alice@example.com")

# Update a user
user.update(name: "Alice Doe")

# Delete a user
user.destroy

etc
```
#### 10. What are before_action, after_action, and skip_before_action?
These controller filters in Rails run specific code before or after an action.
```
before_action
Runs before the controller action.

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user

  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  private

  def authenticate_user
    redirect_to login_path unless current_user
  end
end
after_action
Runs after the action is executed.


class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  after_action :log_activity

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  private

  def log_activity
    Rails.logger.info("Article viewed at #{Time.now}")
  end
end
skip_before_action
Skips the execution of a before_action for certain actions.

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user
  skip_before_action :authenticate_user, only: [:index, :show]

  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end
end
```
#### 11. What are Strong Parameters? Why are they needed?
Strong parameters prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities by requiring attributes to be explicitly permitted.

Unsafe (Vulnerable to Mass Assignment Attack)

```
user = User.new(params[:user]) # An attacker can set `admin: true`
Safe Approach (Strong Parameters)

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    @user.save
  end

  private

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
```

#### 12. How do you define routes in Rails?
Routes define URL patterns and corresponding controller actions.
```
Basic Routes (config/routes.rb):
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/articles", to: "articles#index"
  post "/articles", to: "articles#create"
  get "/articles/:id", to: "articles#show", as: "article"
end
Follow-up: What is the difference between resources and resource?
Method	    Routes   Generated        	Example
resources :users	Creates 7 RESTful routes (index, show, new, create, , update, destroy)	GET /users/:id/
resource :profile	Creates only one route per action (no index route)	GET /profile/
```

#### 13. How do you generate a model, controller, and migration in Rails?
Model:
```
rails generate model User name:string email:string
Creates:

app/models/user.rb
db/migrate/xxxx_create_users.rb
Controller:

rails generate controller Users index show
Creates:

app/controllers/users_controller.rb
app/views/users/index.html.erb
app/views/users/show.html.erb
Migration:


rails generate migration AddAgeToUsers age:integer
rails db:migrate

```


#### 14. What is the config/routes.rb file used for?
This file defines all application routes that map URLs to controllers and actions.

Example:

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "home#index"
  resources :articles
end
root "home#index" → Homepage
resources :articles → Generates RESTful routes

```
 What is the difference between render, redirect_to, and respond_to in controllers?
Method	Purpose	Example
render	Renders a template	render "show"
redirect_to	Redirects to another URL	redirect_to articles_path
respond_to	Responds with different formats (HTML, JSON)	`respond_to {



#### 15. What is flash in Rails? How is it different from session?
Flash Stores temporary messages that last one request.
Commonly used for notifications.

```
flash[:notice] = "Article saved!"
redirect_to articles_path
Session
Stores data across multiple requests.
Used for user authentication.
session[:user_id] = @user.id
```

#### 16. How does Rails handle sessions and cookies?
Session stores data server-side (e.g., in cookies or Redis).
Cookies store small amounts of client-side data.
```
Example (Using Sessions):
session[:user_id] = @user.id
Example (Using Cookies):

cookies[:user_id] = { value: @user.id, expires: 1.week.from_now }
```
#### 17. What is link_to in Rails views?
Used to generate HTML <a> tags dynamically.

```
<%= link_to "Home", root_path %>
Follow-up: How can you make link_to submit a form?
<%= link_to "Delete", article_path(@article), method: :delete, data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>
```
#### 18. What is form_with, and how does it work?
Used to generate forms dynamically in Rails.

```
<%= form_with model: @article, local: true do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
  <%= f.submit "Save" %>
<% end %>
```
#### 19. What is partial in Rails views?
A partial is a reusable view component.

Usage:

```
<%= render "shared/header" %>
Follow-up: How do you pass local variables to a partial?

<%= render "article", article: @article %>
Partial _article.html.erb:


<h2><%= article.title %></h2>
```

#### 20. What is link_to in Rails views?
link_to is a Rails helper method that generates HTML anchor (<a>) tags dynamically.

Basic Usage:

```
<%= link_to "Home", root_path %>
Generates:

<a href="/">Home</a>
Follow-up: How can you make link_to submit a form?
link_to can be used to send DELETE/POST/PUT requests by specifying the method and adding data: { confirm: "Message" }.

<%= link_to "Delete", article_path(@article), method: :delete, data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>
Generates:
<a href="/articles/1" data-method="delete" data-confirm="Are you sure?">Delete</a>
Rails uses JavaScript (UJS) to convert this into a DELETE request.
```

#### 21. What is form_with, and how does it work?
form_with is a Rails helper used to generate forms dynamically.

Basic Example:
```
<%= form_with model: @article, local: true do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
  <%= f.submit "Save" %>
<% end %>
This generates:
<form action="/articles" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="article[title]">
  <input type="submit" value="Save">
</form>
local: true prevents AJAX submissions.

```
### 22. What is a partial in Rails views?
A partial is a reusable view component that helps avoid duplication.

Example:
Create _article.html.erb:
```
<div class="article">
  <h2><%= article.title %></h2>
  <p><%= article.content %></p>
</div>
Use it in another view:
<%= render "article", article: @article %>
Follow-up: How do you pass local variables to a partial?
<%= render "article", article: @article %>
Inside _article.html.erb:
<h2><%= article.title %></h2>
```
#### 23. What is layout in Rails, and how do you use it?
Layouts define a common structure for multiple views.

Example app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
Each view injects its content into <%= yield %>.
```
#### 24. What is yield, and how does it work in Rails layouts?
yield acts as a placeholder for page-specific content inside a layout.

Example app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:
```
<html>
<head><title>My App</title></head>
<body>
  <%= yield %> <!-- Page-specific content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
Usage in app/views/articles/index.html.erb:

<h1>All Articles</h1>
Final Rendered Output:

<html>
<head><title>My App</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>All Articles</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 25. What are helpers in Rails?
Helpers are Ruby methods used in views to keep logic out of templates.

Example Helper (app/helpers/articles_helper.rb):
```
module ArticlesHelper
  def formatted_date(date)
    date.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
  end
end
Usage in a view:

<p>Published on <%= formatted_date(@article.created_at) %></p>
```
Follow-up: When should you use a helper vs. a partial?

Use Case	    Helper	Partial
Formatting data	✅ Yes	❌ No
Repeating view elements	❌ No	✅ Yes

#### 26. What is params in Rails, and how does it work?
params stores request data (e.g., form inputs, URL parameters).

Example Controller:
```
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id]) # Fetch from URL
  end

  def create
    @article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :content)) # Form Data
  end
end
```

#### 27. What is the difference between GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in Rails?
HTTP Method	Purpose	Example Usage
GET	Read data	GET /articles/1
POST	Create data	POST /articles
PUT	Update entire record	PUT /articles/1
DELETE	Delete a record	DELETE /articles/1


#### 28. What is rails routes, and how do you use it?
Lists all available routes in a Rails app.
```
rails routes
Example Output:

articles GET  /articles(.:format)  articles#index
```

#### 29. What is has_many :through, and when do you use it?
It sets up a many-to-many relationship via a join table.
```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_projects
  has_many :projects, through: :user_projects
end

class UserProject < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :project
end

class Project < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_projects
  has_many :users, through: :user_projects
end
```

#### 30. What is validates in Rails models?
validates ensures data integrity before saving records.
```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
  validates :email, uniqueness: true
end
Follow-up: What are some common validation options?
Validation	Example
presence: true	Ensures value is present
uniqueness: true	Ensures unique values
length: { minimum: x }	Min character length
format: { with: /regex/ }	Custom regex validation
```

#### 31. What is rescue_from, and how does it work?
rescue_from handles exceptions globally in controllers.
```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :not_found

  private

  def not_found
    render plain: "404 Not Found", status: :not_found
  end
end
```

#### 32. What is rake, and how does it work in Rails?
Rake (Ruby Make) automates tasks like migrations and seeding.
```
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
Follow-up: What is the difference between rake and rails commands?
Command	Purpose
rake	Runs tasks (e.g., migrations)
rails	Runs commands (e.g., server, console)
```

#### 🛠 1. Handling N+1 Queries (Optimization)
❌ Problem:
```
users = User.all
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts.count
end
```
This results in one query per user, leading to an N+1 query issue.

✅ Solution: Use includes for Eager Loading
```
users = User.includes(:posts)  # Fetch users & posts in 1 query
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts.count  # Does not make extra queries
end
```
👉 includes loads the associated records efficiently.

#### 🛠 2. Implementing Caching in Rails
🔹 Fragment Caching
```
<% cache @article do %>
  <h1><%= @article.title %></h1>
  <p><%= @article.content %></p>
<% end %>
```
👉 Caches the HTML output of the article block.
🔹 Low-Level Caching
```
Rails.cache.fetch("recent_articles", expires_in: 10.minutes) do
  Article.order(created_at: :desc).limit(5)
end
```
👉 Caches query results for 10 minutes.

#### 5. When to Use Proc vs. Lambda
Feature	    Proc	                                                  Lambda
Arity       Check	Allows missing arguments (defaults to nil).	      Strictly enforces the number of arguments.
Return      Behavior	Exits the method immediately.	                Returns control to the method.
Use Case	  Flexible argument handling, quick inline logic.	        Function-like behavior with strict argument handling.

#### 6. Real-World Use Cases
```
Using Proc in Dynamic Method Execution

def perform_action(action)
  actions = {
    greet: Proc.new { puts "Hello!" },
    farewell: Proc.new { puts "Goodbye!" }
  }
  actions[action].call if actions[action]
end

perform_action(:greet)    # Output: "Hello!"
perform_action(:farewell) # Output: "Goodbye!"
```
Using Lambda for Strict Validations
```
validate_input = ->(name, age) {
  raise "Invalid name" if name.nil? || name.empty?
  raise "Invalid age" if age < 18
  "Welcome, #{name}!"
}

puts validate_input.call("Alice", 20)  # ✅ Output: "Welcome, Alice!"
puts validate_input.call("", 25)       # ❌ Raises error "Invalid name"
```

#### Summary
```
Feature	                      Proc (Proc.new)	                                        Lambda (-> {})
Arity (Arguments Handling)	  Doesn't enforce argument count (missing args = nil).	  Strict argument checking (errors if missing).
Return Behavior	              Exits the calling method immediately.	                  Returns control to the calling method.
Use Case	                    When flexibility is needed.	                            When strict function-like behavior is required.
```

💡 TL;DR
Use Procs when you want loose argument handling and early exit behavior.

Use Lambdas when you want strict function-like execution.


#### Explain Sharding ?
Sharding is a database partitioning technique that distributes data across multiple databases or servers to improve performance, scalability, and availability. Instead of storing all records in a single database, data is split (sharded) into multiple databases based on a specific key (e.g., user ID, region, tenant).

 #### Why Use Sharding?
#### ✅ Benefits of Sharding
Scalability –            Distributes load across multiple database instances.

Performance –            Reduces query time by limiting the data each query scans.

Fault Tolerance –        Failure in one shard doesn’t affect others.

Multi-tenancy Support – Different customers (tenants) can be stored in separate databases.


#### How Does Sharding Work in Rails?
Rails 6+ provides built-in support for database sharding using the multiple databases feature (config/database.yml).

Example: User Data Sharded Across Multiple Databases
```
# config/database.yml
production:
  primary:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: main_db
    host: db1.example.com
  shard_1:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: shard1_db
    host: db2.example.com
  shard_2:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: shard2_db
    host: db3.example.com
Each database (shard_1, shard_2) contains a subset of the total records.
```
#### 🔹 Implementing Sharding in Rails
Step 1: Define Database Connections
Modify database.yml to add shard configurations.

Step 2: Switch Between Shards in Models
Use connects_to in the model:
```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  connects_to database: { writing: :shard_1, reading: :shard_1 }
end
```
Step 3: Manually Switch Shards in Queries
```
ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :writing, shard: :shard_1) do
  User.create(name: "Alice")
end
```
Step 4: Auto-Route Requests Based on Shard Key
Example: Shard based on user region.
```
def set_shard
  user_region = params[:region]  # Example: "asia"
  shard = "shard_#{user_region}"
  ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :writing, shard: shard) do
    yield
  end
end
```
This method automatically connects to the appropriate shard.

#### When to Use Sharding?
Use Case	                                              Should You Use Sharding?
Millions of rows per table	                            ✅ Yes
Multi-tenancy (separate databases per customer)	        ✅ Yes
Geo-distributed applications	                          ✅ Yes
Simple CRUD apps with low traffic	                      ❌ No
Short-term performance issues (use indexing instead)	  ❌ No

Alternatives to Sharding
Read Replicas – Separate read and write databases (primary, replica).

Partitioning – Store different data segments in the same database (PostgreSQL table partitioning).

TL;DR
Sharding splits data across multiple databases to improve performance and scalability.

Rails 6+ supports multi-database configurations (connects_to, connected_to).

Use sharding when dealing with high-volume, multi-tenant, or geographically distributed applications.

### 🧠 Problem 1: Dynamic Method Generation (Metaprogramming)
Challenge: Write a class CurrencyConverter that dynamically defines methods like to_usd, to_eur, to_gbp, and converts from a base amount in cents (as integer) to those currencies using given exchange rates.

### 🧠 Problem 2: Lazy Prime Generator (Enumerators)
Challenge: Write a method lazy_primes(n) that lazily generates the first n prime numbers using Ruby's enumerators.

### 🧠 Problem 3: Safe Concurrency with Threads
Challenge: Create a counter that increments safely from multiple threads (simulate 100 threads incrementing a shared counter 1000 times each). Use a mutex to avoid race conditions.


### 🚀 Intermediate Rails Questions
#### 1. Handling Exceptions & Logging
Use rescue_from in controllers to handle specific exceptions:
```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :not_found
  rescue_from StandardError, with: :handle_error

  private

  def not_found
    render json: { error: "Record not found" }, status: :not_found
  end

  def handle_error(exception)
    Rails.logger.error(exception.message)
    render json: { error: "Something went wrong" }, status: :internal_server_error
  end
end
```
Use Rollbar, Sentry, or Bugsnag for error notifications.

#### 2. Database Modeling Considerations
Normalize data when needed (e.g., extract a tags table if storing repeated text).
Use indexes for faster lookups (add_index :users, :email, unique: true).
Optimize eager loading to avoid N+1 queries.

#### 3. Managing Migrations
Keep migrations idempotent (avoid destructive changes in production).

Use change method over up and down unless a complex rollback is needed.
Example:
```
class AddIndexToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_index :users, :email, unique: true
  end
end
```
#### 4. Caching Mechanisms
Page Caching: Stores full HTML response (caches_page :index).

Action Caching: Caches entire actions but checks authentication.

Fragment Caching: Caches parts of a view:
```
<% cache @user do %>
  <%= render @user.profile %>
<% end %>
```
SQL Query Caching: Enabled by default in Rails.

#### 5. RESTful API Design
Versioning: /api/v1/users
Security Considerations:
Use JWT or OAuth2 for authentication.

Add rate limiting with rack-attack.

#### 6. Service Objects for Business Logic
Service objects keep controllers clean:
```
class UserCreator
  def initialize(user_params)
    @user_params = user_params
  end

  def call
    User.create(@user_params)
  end
end
```
Benefits: Reusable, testable, and scalable.

#### 7. Nested Routes & Advanced Routing
```
resources :authors do
  resources :books, only: [:index, :show]
end
```
Use shallow routes to avoid deep nesting:
```
resources :books, shallow: true do
  resources :reviews
end
```
8. Polymorphic Associations
Use when a model can belong to multiple models:
```
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end
Example:

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end

class Video < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end
```

#### 9. N+1 Query Problem & Optimization
Use includes or preload:
```
Post.includes(:comments).each do |post|
  puts post.comments.count
end
```
Use bullet gem to detect N+1.

10. Database Transactions & Performance
Wrap operations in transactions:
```
User.transaction do
  user.update!(balance: user.balance - 100)
  Payment.create!(user: user, amount: 100)
end
Indexing:
add_index :orders, :user_id
```
#### 11. Caching in a Distributed Rails App
Use Redis as a caching layer.

Use low-level caching with Rails.cache.fetch.

#### 12. Rails Security
CSRF Protection: protect_from_forgery with: :exception

XSS Protection: Use sanitize for user input.

SQL Injection Prevention: Always use ActiveRecord’s query methods:

User.where("email = ?", params[:email])
13. REST vs. GraphQL
REST: Good for simple CRUD APIs.

GraphQL: Good for complex frontends needing flexible data fetching.

#### 14. Scaling Rails
Use read replicas and database sharding.

Move long tasks to background jobs.

#### 15. Handling Concurrency
Use Redis locks to prevent race conditions.

#### 16. Sharding in Rails
Use octopus gem or Rails 6 multiple databases feature.

#### 17. Rails Testing
Unit tests: RSpec or Minitest

Integration tests: Capybara

Performance testing: Benchmark

#### 18. Real-Time Features (ActionCable)
```
class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "chat_#{params[:room]}"
  end
end
```
Challenges: Scaling with Redis, handling connections.

#### 19. Refactoring Legacy Rails Code
Use rubocop for code consistency.

Gradually introduce service objects.

#### 20. Rails 6/7 Features
Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus)

ActionText (Rich Text ing)

ActionMailbox (Incoming Emails Handling)

### Ruby-Specific Questions
#### 1. Rack & Middleware
Rack is a lightweight interface between web servers and Ruby frameworks.
```
Custom Middleware:

class LoggerMiddleware
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    Rails.logger.info "Request received: #{env['PATH_INFO']}"
    @app.call(env)
  end
end
```
#### 2. N+1 Query
Solved using includes, preload, or eager_load.

#### 3. Concerns in Rails
Use concerns for shared logic:
```
module Taggable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_many :tags
  end
end
```
#### 4. HABTM vs HMT
HABTM: Direct many-to-many without extra fields.

HMT: Uses a join model for additional attributes.

#### 5. Class vs. Instance Variables
```
class User
  @@class_var = "class var"
  @instance_var = "instance var"
end
```
#### 6. Mutable vs. Immutable in Ruby
Strings are mutable, Numbers & Booleans are immutable.

#### 7. Ruby GC (Garbage Collection)
Ruby uses Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collection.

#### 8. include vs extend
include adds instance methods.

extend adds class methods.

#### 9. Threads vs. Fibers
Threads: Pre-emptive (run in parallel).

Fibers: Cooperative (manual yielding).

#### 10. Proc vs. Lambda
Lambdas check arity (number of arguments), Procs don’t.

### Final Questions
#### Mass Assignment & Protection:


params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
CSRF Protection:


protect_from_forgery with: :exception
ActiveRecord Callbacks: before_save, after_commit, etc.

Convention Over Configuration: Rails’ opinionated design.

Difference Between save and save!: save! raises an exception on failure.

#### Please share the type of associations in rails and how they are formed?
📌 Associations in Rails and How They Are Formed
Associations in Rails define relationships between models, allowing efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

1. belongs_to Association
```
One-to-One or Many-to-One relationship
```
The child model holds the foreign key.

Example: A Book belongs to an Author
```
class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
```
```
class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end
```
The books table must have an author_id column.

Foreign key: author_id in books.

```
class AddAuthorToBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_reference :books, :author, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```
#### 2. has_one Association
One-to-One relationship

The parent model has one associated record.

Example: A User has one Profile
```

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile
end

class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
Foreign key: user_id in profiles.


class AddUserToProfiles < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_reference :profiles, :user, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```

####  3. has_many Association
One-to-Many relationship

A record has many related records.
```
Example: An Author has many Books

class Author < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
end

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
Foreign key: author_id in books.
```
####  4. has_many :through Association
Many-to-Many relationship with a join table containing additional attributes.

Example: Doctor has many Patients through Appointments
```
class Doctor < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :patients, through: :appointments
end

class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :doctors, through: :appointments
end

class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :doctor
  belongs_to :patient
end
Join table: appointments (with doctor_id and patient_id).

class CreateAppointments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :appointments do |t|
      t.references :doctor, foreign_key: true
      t.references :patient, foreign_key: true
      t.datetime :appointment_date
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```
#### 5. has_and_belongs_to_many (HABTM)
Direct Many-to-Many relationship without additional attributes.

Example: Students and Courses
```
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :courses
end

class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :students
end
Requires a join table (courses_students) with no extra columns.

class CreateCoursesStudentsJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_join_table :courses, :students do |t|
      t.index :course_id
      t.index :student_id
    end
  end
end
```
📝 HABTM vs. has_many :through

Use has_many :through if the join table needs extra columns (e.g., appointments.date).

Use HABTM if the join table is purely relational.

####  6. polymorphic Association
A model can belong to multiple other models using a single association.

Example: A Comment can belong to both Post and Video
```
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end

class Video < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :comments, as: :commentable
end
```
The comments table has:

commentable_type (stores "Post" or "Video")

commentable_id (stores the related record’s ID)

```
class CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :comments do |t|
      t.text :body
      t.references :commentable, polymorphic: true, index: true
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```
####  7. self-join (Recursive Association)
A model associates with itself.

Example: Employees reporting to a Manager
```
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :manager, class_name: "Employee", optional: true
  has_many :subordinates, class_name: "Employee", foreign_key: "manager_id"
end
```
Foreign key: manager_id in employees.
```
class AddManagerToEmployees < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_reference :employees, :manager, foreign_key: { to_table: :employees }
  end
end
```
#### Summary Table
```
